## Course Information 

The workshop will meet on select Wednesays in Humanities Gateway 303, from 10am to 1pm. See the [calendar](##calendar) below for a detailed schedule. There will be no writing assignments for the workshop. Credit is dependent on attendance, reading and **active** participation. You can make up for a missed session by preparing a kick-off presentation the next session. The readings for every session are roughly equivalent to a short book.
