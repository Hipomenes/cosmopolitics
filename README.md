If thinking is the art of discovering difference, “cosmopolitics” is the art of establishing relational grammars across species and determinations of being—a form of ontological diplomacy. In contemporary usage, it names the epistemic, political and legal strategies that seek to build human-non-human assemblages, coalitions *contra naturam*. Hijacking “cosmopolitics” from Kant, Belgian philosopher of science Isabelle Stengers adopted the ancient notion of *kosmopoliḗtēs* (Diog. Laert 6.63) as a leitmotif. She proposed moving beyond the universal triumphalism of the history of science into an “ecology of practices of knowledge,” drawing inspiration from William James’ pluralism and Ernst Mach’s phenomenological constructivism. For Stengers, the ‘cosmos’ in cosmopolitics does not allude to the unified objective world of modern science, the bedrock grounding subjective or culturalist representations, but to an “unknown, constituted by multiple, divergent worlds”; a relational field of non-equivalence in which relations need to be constantly created and re-established, not discovered. Brazilian anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro later called such an ontology, amply illustrated in Amerindian socio-cosmologies, “multinaturalism”.This workshop seeks to delineate a possible genealogy of cosmopolitics as an epistemic paradigm across the humanities and social sciences as much as a political strategy.

The workshop will meet on select Wednesays during Fall 2024, Winter and Spring of 2025 from 10am to 1pm. See the calendar below for a detailed schedule. There are no writing assignments for the workshop, so credit is dependent on attendance, reading and **active** participation. Full attendance of the 10 workshop sessions is expected, but you can make up for a missed session by preparing a kick-off presentation. The reading load will be equivalent to a short book for every session.
