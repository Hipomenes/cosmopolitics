# CRITICAL THEORY WORKSHOP

# *Cosmopolitics*


## Proceedings


### Introduction (Sep 25)

- I take the name of a “Critical Theory Workshop” seriously: ‘critical theory’ implies thinking with a sense of urgency and the need for an emancipatory horizon; and I understand ‘workshop’ as a place of intellectual experimentation and play, disassembly and reassembly of texts and arguments, and ideally, of creation of concepts.
- In this sense, despite my initial misgivings about Stengers’s short essay as true introduction to the question of cosmopolitics, I believe that at its most general level the essay expresses two elements that I want to incorporate into the ethos of the workshop: concepts first emerge as challenges, not yet fully stabilized nor formalized. And this “not yet”, this slowing down of every claim to universality, theoretical coherence or operative closure, is the fundamental gesture of Stenger’s essay, who never ceases to affix the term “proposal” to cosmopolitanism.
- The workshop is also organized around a proposal of sorts. The guiding motif of the workshop is that of an unforeseen but incredibly productive convergence of two independent intellectual genealogies, and the space that their convergence makes possible to think. A good way to think about this is to conceive of two intersecting curves, as shown in this[ ](https://github.com/Hipomenes/cosmopolitics/blob/main/assets/images/two-trajectories.png)[diagram drawn in my fridge](https://github.com/Hipomenes/cosmopolitics/blob/main/assets/images/two-trajectories.png). One line is constituted by Stenger’s proposal, developed in her 7-volumen *Cosmopolitics*, of moving beyond the universal triumphalism of Western rationality and science into an “ecology of practices of knowledge”, and from a *kosmos*, understood really as the old Greek *oecumene*, into a Jamesian pluriverse. The other curve takes us to an entirely different tradition: Amerindian anthropology, and more concretely Amazonian (and to a lesser extent Andean) anthropology as developed by French and Brazilian scholars such as Philippe Descola, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Renato Sztutman and others; a veritable revolution that for sake of convenience we can refer to either as the Ontological Turn or as Perspectivism. (This tradition branches out from the work of Roy Wagner, Peter Gow, Marilyn Strathern, Pierre Clastres and ultimately of the Levi-Strauss of the *Mythologiques*, that no one reads.) In a book we'll read, Viveiros de Castro drew explicitly from Stengers to speak about an Amerindian Cosmopolitics, while others developed an understanding of social practices and ritual action as a process of “ontological diplomacy”, mediating relations between  humans and non-humans.
  - ` `Because this is a workshop and not an exercise in intellectual history, more than reconstructing these two curves and their point of convergence, the reading list proposes a series of themes and genealogies that fall within the space that becomes thinkable between both curves.
- A very interesting conversation, led by Ati, Fred, Fer, Mingiu and Egor, took place regarding the fundamental meaning of Stenger's claims of absolute independence (even ignorance of) from Kant's notion of *cosmopolitanism* (a notion generally associated to Kant’s 1795 *Perpetual Peace*), and itself derived from the Greek (Stoic) ideal of a “citizen of the cosmos/world.” As Egor noted, the notion of *cosmopolitanism* (that, by the way, also finds echoes in Derrida's notion of *hospitality*) is embedded in our international political system, and shapes both the legal and institutional framework of international governance as well as our common sense regarding an ideal political system (or what Latour calls the “Habermas Club”). So we perhaps should take Stengers’s disclaimer with a grain or salt, or better still, as Mingu hinted to, reflect about the kind of work the cosmopolitical (proposal) performs against the backdrop of standard, liberal cosmopolitanism.
  - (I may add here that another corollary of Egor’s point, if I may push it further, is the fact that Kantian *cosmopolitanism* is not only an idealized political concept, but a very concrete point of enunciation: that of Western or rather North Atlantic liberal international governance. This is of course an explicit reference to NATO, but authorized and mediated by Michel-Rolph Trouillot’s “[North Atlantic Universals: Analytical Fictions, 1492-1945,”](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/39116) an essay that we should perhaps include in the reading list.  
- At any rate, the conversation led me to formulate a question, once again an invitation to slow down: why keep the unavoidable reference to *cosmopolitanism*, with all its stuffy (and violent!) Kantian-Habermasian-Rawlsian-NATOesque trappings while proposing an uncompromising challenge to every form of universalism, *especially* the universalism of nature (Stengers)? Why didn’t Stenger just pull off a neologism out of her philosopher’s hat? We did not reach an answer (just yet!), but we can certainly learn something from the general gesture of using a (divided, enlarged and reassembled) version of the concept against itself, as a roadblock or obstacle preventing it from finally closing its grasp and imposing its authority. We’ll see.
